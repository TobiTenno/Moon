<center><a href="https://tobitenno.github.io"><b>MAtej</b></a> is a software developer by day and a code addict by night.</center>

## Who am I?

A software developer at [my current employment](https://cerner.com) since gratuating from college.

A husband. I've been married for almost 4 years at time of writing this. My wife is important to me.

A gamer. I grew up playing simple puzzle and Star Wars shooter games on a hand-me-down computer from my eldest brother and still play games, such as [Warframe](https://warframe.com) to this day.

A community manager. Along with several other staff, I run the [Warframe Community Discord](https://discord.gg/warframe) and enjoy both hanging out with friends as well as making new ones while giving Tenno, the name of Warframe's players, a safe and welcoming place to talk and play.

A code tinkerer. At work, I professionally develop code following processes. At home, and in my free time, I spend my time breaking my code a lot to make it do what I like, both for displaying for others, as well as making nice data for them. You can see more info in [here](/projects) about that.

## Contact

The easiest ways to contact me are by ~~fax or telephone~~ [discord message](https://discord.gg/warframe) or [email](mailto:tobiah@protonmail.com).

I'm also available on StackOverflow, Twitter, and if you know me really well, over the telephone.
