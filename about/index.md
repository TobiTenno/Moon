<center><a href="https://matej.voboril.dev"><b>Matej</b></a> is a software developer by day and a code addict by night.</center>

## Who am I?

A software developer at [my current employment](https://cerner.com) since gratuating from college.

A husband. I've been married since 2014 to a wonderful woman that challenges me daily.

A gamer. I grew up playing simple puzzle and Star Wars shooter games on a hand-me-down computer from my eldest brother and still play games, such as [Warframe](https://warframe.com) to this day.

A code tinkerer. At work, I professionally develop code following processes. At home, and in my free time, I spend my time breaking my code a lot to make it do what I like, both for displaying for others, as well as making nice data for them. You can see more info in [here](/projects) about that.

## Contact

The easiest ways to contact me are by ~~fax or telephone~~ [discord message](discord:///users/76685590585671680) or [email](mailto:tobiah@pm.me).

I'm also available on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2518037/matej-voboril), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tobitenno), and if you know me really well, over the telephone.
